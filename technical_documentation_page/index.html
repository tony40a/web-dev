      <p>
        Welcome to Blender, the free and open source 3D creation suite.
      </p>
<p>Blender can be used to create 3D visualizations such as still images, 3D animations, VFX shots, and video editing.</p>
<p>Blender is well suited to individuals and small studios who benefit from its unified pipeline and responsive development process.</p>
<p>Blender is a cross-platform application, running on Linux, macOS, and Windows systems. Blender also has relatively small memory and drive requirements compared to other 3D creation suites. Its interface uses OpenGL to provide a consistent experience across all supported hardware and platforms.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Blender is a fully integrated 3D content creation suite, offering a broad range of essential tools, including Modeling, Rendering, Animation & Rigging, Video Editing, VFX, Compositing, Texturing, and many types of Simulations.</li>
        <li>It is cross platform, with an OpenGL GUI that is uniform on all major platforms (and customizable with Python scripts).</li>
        <li>It has a high-quality 3D architecture, enabling fast and efficient creation workflow.</li>
        <li>It boasts active community support, see blender.org/community for an extensive list of sites.</li>
        <li>It has a small executable, which is optionally portable.</li>

      <p>The Python Console is a quick way to execute commands, with access to the entire Python API, command history and auto-complete.</p>
      <h2>Accessing Built-in Python Console</h2>
      <p>
        By pressing Shift-F4 in any Blender Editor type (3D View, Timeline, etc.) you can change it to a Console Editor.
      </p>
      <img src = "https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/_images/editors_python-console_default.png">
      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>Change X location to a value of 1:</p>
      <code>bpy.context.object.location.x = 1</code>
      <p>Move object from previous X location by 0.5 unit:</p>
      <code>bpy.context.object.location.x += 0.5</code>
      <p>Change X, Y, Z location:</p>
      <code>bpy.context.object.location = (1, 2, 3)</code>
      <p>Change only the X, Y components:</p>
      <code>bpy.context.object.location.xy = (1, 2)</code>
      <p>Data type of object’s location:</p>
      <code>type(bpy.context.object.location)</code>

    <article>
      <p>Scenes are a way to organize your work. Each blend-file can contain multiple scenes, which share other data such as objects and materials.</p>  
      <p>Scene management and library appending/linking are based on Blender’s Library and Data System, so it is a good idea to read that manual page first, if you are not familiar with the basics of that system.</p>
      <p>You can select and create scenes with the Scene data-block menu in the Topbar.</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Modeling">
    <header>Modeling</header>
    <article>
      <p>The creation of a 3D scene needs at least three key components: Models, Materials and Lights. In this part, the first of these is covered, that being modeling. Modeling is simply the art and science of creating a surface that either mimics the shape of a real-world object or expresses your imagination of abstract objects.</p>
      <h2>Modes</h2>
     <p>Depending on the type of object you are trying to model, there are different types of modeling mode. Since modes are not specific to modeling they are covered in different parts of the manual.</p>
      <p>Switching between modes while modeling is common. Some tools may be available in more than one mode while others may be unique to a particular mode.</p>
      <h2>Edit Mode</h2>
      <p>Edit mode is the main mode where modeling takes place. Edit mode is used to edit the following types of objects:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Meshes</li>
        <li>Curves</li>
        <li>Surfaces</li>
        <li>Metaballs</li>
        <li>Text objects</li>
        <li>Lattice</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can only modify the mesh of the objects you are editing. To modify other objects you can leave Edit Mode, select another object and enter Edit Mode, or use Multi-Object Modes.</p>

    <header>Sculpting & Painting</header>
    <article>
      <p>Sculpting and painting uses brushes to paint directly on meshes. There are several modes that uses this.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sculpting: Change the topology of the mesh.</li>
        <li>Vertex Paint: Change the color of vertices in the active vertex color layer.</li>
        <li>Weight Paint: Change the weight of vertices in the active vertex group.</li>
        <li>Texture Paint: Change the pixels of the active image texture.</li>
      </ul>
